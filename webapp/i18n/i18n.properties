projectHistory=Initiated in mid-2015, our team's goal was always to make free content for other Linux users who wanted to enjoy a different appearance than the stock theme. We started by producing our well-known Windows 10 theme, quickly followed by a OS X 10.11 theme and some Windows XP-based themes. In fact, our Windows XP Embedded and Zune started around that period of time.
projectHistory_2=From there on, we developped a multitude of themes, many of which are still maintained and functional. During the years, we tried developing a generation framework, failed, took a break, came back, retried making a framework, failed again, updated everything to GTK 3.20 in a solid manner, developped a new reference theme, generated a new reference theme, migrated it to SASS, made a framework, migrated everything GTK3-related to SASS and then started updating other aspects of the themes (shell themes, window manager themes, etc.)
